/**
 *  \page drm Digital Rights Management
 *
 *  Here is a brief explanation of how the DRM system works on the client. 
 *
 *  Foundation fopr the DRM is provided by the dpdev::Device interface. Following description assumes familiarity
 *  with dpdev module.
 *
 *  To manage device activation and fulfill the content to the device, create an instance of dpdrm::DRMProcessor
 *  using the dpdev::Device object that you want to work with. You have to register networking provider (see
 *  dpnet::NetProvider) and provide dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient object
 *  that gets notified when DRM operations complete or produce some results.
 *
 *  dpdrm::DRMProcessor can only handle a single DRM workflow at a time. It is the caller's responsibility
 *  to never start multiple workflows simultaneously. Also, never create multiple dpdrm::DRMProcessor objects
 *  using the same device.
 *
 *  \section activation Activation
 *
 *  To check if the device is activated, call dpdrm::DRMProcessor::getActivations. If the list
 *  that it returns has at least 1 item, the device is activated. If the device is not activated,
 *  it needs to be activated to be able to open DRM-protected documents.
 *
 *  Device activation is typically a one-time operation. For network-capable devices it can be
 *  performed by supplying appropriate workflow codes (DW_AUTH_SIGN_IN|DW_ACTIVATE), user's
 *  AdobeID, and user's password to the dpdrm::DRMProcessor::initAdobeIDSignIn method and then 
 *  dpdrm::DRMProcessor::startWorkflows. dpdrm::DRMProcessor will communicate to Adobe activation
 *  server and in the end dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient::workflowsDone will be called. If no errors
 *  were reported with calls to dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient::reportWorkflowError, activation is successfull.
 *
 *  Once the device is activated, the content that was licensed to that user (e.g. content transferred from
 *  some other system which user already has) should work as long as this device is trusted and present in the
 *  environment.
 *
 *  \section fulfillment Fulfillment
 *
 *  Provisioning new content to the user and the device is called fulfillment. Fulfillment starts when a
 *  distributor provides the client with a little XML message called ".acsm file". It can be detected by its mime
 *  type "application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml". The content of this message should be passed to
 *  dpdrm::DRMProcessor::initWorkflows call. If ACSM file indeed contains fulfillment token (which will not
 *  always be true), DW_FULFILL and DW_DOWNLOAD bits will be set in the result. Start fulfillment workflow
 *  by calling dpdrm::DRMProcessor::startWorkflows(DW_FULFILL|DW_DOWNLOAD). When the license is acquired
 *  and the content is downloaded, dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient::workflowsDone will be called. If no errors were
 *  reported during fulfillment, it was successful. Newly-fulfilled documents will be added to the library
 *  (see dplib::Library).
 *
 *  The final and very important step of the fulfillment process is notifying the server that fulfillment is
 *  complete. dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient::workflowsDone call will provide a "follow-up" data which should be
 *  used to initialize notification workflow using dpdrm::DRMProcessor::initWorkflows. Start it using usual
 *  dpdrm::DRMProcessor::startWorkflows call. Notification should be retried until successful, so the
 *  "follow-up" data should be stored in device non-volatile storage, so that it can be retried even after
 *  the device is powered down.
 *
 *  \section loans Returnable Loans
 *
 *  DRM client support returnable loan feature. What is commonly called "loans" are actually two very different
 *  types of licenses: expiring licenses and returnable licenses. Expiring licenses simply stop working
 *  after the expiration time. Returnable licenses work until they are returned. In Content Server 4 ecosystem
 *  only returnable licenses are called loans. Note that returnable licenses do not have to expire, even though
 *  they typically are configured to expire; however, it is the ability to return them which makes them special.
 *
 *  Each device activation record
 *  holds server-signed tokens with lists of outstanding loans (called "loan tokens"). Each
 *  time a loan is taken, the loan id is added to the list and when loan is returned, loan id is removed from it.
 *  Loaned content is only readable if the corresponding loan id is on record in the main device (the first DeviceInfo
 *  object on the list).
 *
 *  When a fulfillment transaction is returnable, dplib::ContentRecord objects that it creates will be tagged with
 *  "adept:borrowed" tag. Loan is is the same as fulfillmentID (available by calling
 *  dplib::ContentRecord::getFulfillmentID).
 *
 *  To return a loan call dpdrm::DRMProcessor::initLoanReturnWorkflow followed by dpdrm::DRMProcessor::startWorkflows.
 *  One new loan token is issued and written
 *  into the device activation record, dpdrm::DRMProcessorClient::workflowsDone callback will be called. At that point all
 *  loaned content must be erased and the same notification procedure as for fulfillment started.
 *
 *  \section attached Attached Device Issues
 *
 *  Tethered devices which are not network-capable have to be activated while they are plugged into a PC. In general,
 *  they are activated to the same user account as the PC. To avoid asking the user for his AdobeID again, 
 *  tethered devices DRMProcessor should be initialized with the user credentials from the PC dpdev::Device by
 *  calling dpdrm::DRMProcessor::transferCredentialsFrom.
 *
 *  When loaned content is transferred to an attached device, corresponding loan token needs to be transferred with it.
 *  This can be done using embed::DRMProcessor::transferLoanTokensFrom. It transfers most recent loan tokens from the 
 *  source device to the target device (device managed by dpdrm::DRMProcessor object).

 *
 *  Display element is a permission to render the document on screen, excerpt element is a permission for copy to
 *  the clipboard, print element is a permission to render the document for printing. Each permission can have
 *  additional constraints on it. Device element restricts usage to a particular device only, until element
 *  contains permission expiration time (using using W3C date and time format: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime),
 *  count element restricts the usage to a certain number of times/pages, and loan element restricts the
 *  usage until the time when a loan with the given id was returned. MaxResolution constraint can be used only
 *  inside the print element and limits the bitmap resolution that can be sent to the printer. Permission elements
 *  that are not understood by the host (including permissions that contain constraints that are not understood)
 *  must be ignored. Top-level permissions element can contain multiple permissions of the same type (e.g. print);
 *  typically they would differ by the associated constraints. A permission of some type is considered granted if
 *  there is at least one permission element of a given type where all constraints are satisfied.
